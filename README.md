# Welcome to my page

Since I just recently started learning coding, you will see a lot of changes on this page in the coming weeks while I'm trying to expand my skill set to become a full stack web developer.

The following table should give you an idea on my level of expertise:
| Language | Expertise Level (0 - 10) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Markdown | you be the judge |
| JS | 0 |
| HTML | 1 |
| CSS | 1 |
| react | 0 |
