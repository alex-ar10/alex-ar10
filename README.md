# Welcome to my page

I'm a goal-driven and detail-oriented Full Stack Web Developer with a successful
track record as a Sales Manager. Building modular web apps with experience in
React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Rest APIs and mongoDB has
become my new passion. I bring with me broad technical, interpersonal as well
as adaptable business skills that will help me deliver on challenging objectives. I
am detail-oriented, very resourceful, and goal-driven.
